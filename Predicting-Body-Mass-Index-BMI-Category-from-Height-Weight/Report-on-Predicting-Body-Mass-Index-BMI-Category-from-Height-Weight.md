## 2. INTRODUCTION

### 2.1 Background

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a widely used metric for assessing body weight relative to height, serving as an important indicator of health risks and nutritional status. The traditional manual calculation and categorization of BMI can be time-consuming in large-scale healthcare settings, creating a need for automated classification systems.

### 2.2 Problem Statement

Healthcare providers, fitness applications, and research institutions require efficient methods to:

- Automatically classify individuals into BMI categories
- Process large volumes of demographic data quickly
- Provide consistent and accurate health assessments
- Support preventive healthcare initiatives
- Enable population health monitoring

### 2.3 Motivation

With the increasing adoption of digital health platforms and the need for automated health screening tools, machine learning offers a powerful approach to BMI categorization that can:

- Reduce manual processing time
- Improve consistency in health assessments
- Enable real-time health monitoring
- Support data-driven healthcare decisions
- Facilitate large-scale epidemiological studies

### 2.4 BMI Categories

The World Health Organization defines four primary BMI categories:

- **Underweight**: BMI < 18.5 kg/mÂ²
- **Normal weight**: 18.5 â‰¤ BMI < 25 kg/mÂ²
- **Overweight**: 25 â‰¤ BMI < 30 kg/mÂ²
- **Obese**: BMI â‰¥ 30 kg/mÂ²
