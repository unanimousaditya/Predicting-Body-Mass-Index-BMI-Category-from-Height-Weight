Research has consistently identified key demographic variables important for BMI-related predictions:

**Anthropometric Measurements**: Height and weight represent the most fundamental predictive features, with numerous studies confirming their primary importance in BMI-related modeling (WHO, 2000).

**Age Effects**: Age demonstrates significant associations with BMI patterns, with research indicating non-linear relationships between age and weight status across different life stages (Flegal et al., 2016).

**Gender Differences**: Gender-specific differences in body composition and metabolic patterns contribute to BMI prediction accuracy. Research has shown that gender-stratified models often outperform combined approaches (Jackson et al., 2002).

**Socioeconomic Factors**: Educational level, income, and occupational status have been identified as important predictive factors in BMI-related research, though data availability often limits their inclusion in predictive models (Drewnowski & Specter, 2004).

#### 3.4.2 Feature Engineering Strategies

Successful BMI prediction models employ various feature engineering approaches:

**Interaction Terms**: Creating interaction terms between age and gender, or height and weight ratios, can improve model performance by capturing complex relationships between variables.

**Categorical Encoding**: Appropriate encoding of categorical variables (gender, age groups) significantly impacts model performance. Research suggests that careful attention to encoding strategies can improve prediction accuracy by 5-10%.

**Normalization and Scaling**: Different algorithms have varying sensitivity to feature scaling. Research indicates that distance-based algorithms (SVM, k-NN) benefit significantly from feature normalization, while tree-based methods are generally robust to scaling differences.

### 3.5 Model Evaluation and Validation
